At this moment the game has:
- Camera/animation/sound settings
- HUD 
- VFX effects made in Blueprints 
- One character with complete animation 
- One simple level with randonmly spawned enemies
- Three types of weapons and damages

In total, it took about 30 hours from start to end. In the result, there is one completed level with most typical elements of the action game. For the future, this project can be developed further with modification of the AI, adding general inventory, customization of the character, or multiplayer regime.
